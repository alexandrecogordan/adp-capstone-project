    "provided at no cost to you and begins on your first day of employment with no waing period or\n",
    "medical requirements. The coverage amount adjusts annually based on your current salary, so if\n",
    "you receive raises or promoons, your basic life insurance coverage increases accordingly.\n",
    "For example, if your annual salary is $45,000, your basic life insurance coverage would be\n",
    "$45,000. If you earn $75,000 annually, your coverage would be $75,000. However, if your salary\n",
    "exceeds $100,000, your basic coverage would be capped at the $100,000 maximum. This\n",
    "automac coverage ensures that every employee has some level of protecon for their family\n",
    "without any acon required on their part.\n",
    "The basic life insurance coverage also includes an equal amount of accidental death and\n",
    "dismemberment (AD&D) coverage at no addional cost. AD&D coverage provides the full benefit\n",
    "amount in case of accidental death and paral benefits for specific injuries such as loss of limbs or\n",
    "sight. This coverage is effecve 24 hours a day, seven days a week, anywhere in the world.\n",
    "While the basic coverage provides a foundaon of protecon, it may not be sufficient for\n",
    "employees with significant financial obligaons or dependents. We encourage all employees to\n",
    "evaluate their total insurance needs and consider whether supplemental coverage would be\n",
    "appropriate for their situaon.\n",
    "\n",
    "TechLance offers voluntary supplemental life insurance that allows you to purchase addional\n",
    "coverage beyond the basic amount provided by the company. Supplemental coverage is available\n",
    "in increments of $10,000, ranging from $50,000 to $500,000, with a maximum total coverage\n",
    "(including basic) of five mes your annual salary or $1,000,000, whichever is less.\n",
    "The cost of supplemental life insurance is based on your age and whether you use tobacco\n",
    "products, with rates calculated per $1,000 of coverage per month. For example, a 35-year-old\n",
    "non-smoker would pay approximately $0.12 per month for each $1,000 of coverage, which\n",
    "means $100,000 of supplemental coverage would cost about $12 per month. Rates increase with\n",
    "age, so a 45-year-old non-smoker would pay approximately $0.28 per month per $1,000 of\n",
    "coverage.\n",
    "Tobacco users pay significantly higher rates due to increased health risks, with rates typically\n",
    "double or more compared to non-tobacco users. The insurance company defines tobacco use as\n",
    "any use of cigarees, cigars, pipes, or smokeless tobacco products within the past 12 months.\n",
    "For coverage amounts up to $150,000, no medical exam or health quesons are required if you\n",
    "enroll within 30 days of becoming eligible or during annual open enrollment. However, if you\n",
    "want coverage exceeding $150,000, or if you’re enrolling outside of the inial eligibility period,\n",
    "you’ll need to complete evidence of insurability forms and possibly undergo a medical exam at no\n",
    "cost to you.\n",
    "\n",
    "TechLance also offers life insurance coverage for your spouse or domesc partner and dependent\n",
    "children, providing addional financial protecon for your family. Spouse coverage is available in\n",
    "amounts of $10,000, $25,000, $50,000, or $75,000, though the total amount cannot exceed 50%\n",
    "of your own life insurance coverage (basic plus supplemental combined).\n",
    "The cost of spouse coverage is based on their age and follows a similar rate structure to\n",
    "employee supplemental coverage. For coverage amounts over $50,000, your spouse may need to\n",
    "complete health quesonnaires or undergo medical underwring, depending on their age and\n",
    "health status.\n",
    "Dependent child coverage is available for children from 14 days old through age 26 if they qualify\n",
    "as dependents under your health insurance. Coverage amounts are $5,000 or $10,000 per child,\n",
    "and one premium covers all eligible children in your family. Child life insurance costs only $2-4\n",
    "per month regardless of how many children you have, and no medical exams are required.\n",
    "While child life insurance provides relavely small death benefits, it can help cover final expenses\n",
    "and provides the valuable benefit of guaranteed future insurability. Children covered under the\n",
    "company plan can typically convert to individual coverage when they’re no longer eligible as\n",
    "dependents, regardless of their health status at that me.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most important aspects of life insurance is ensuring that you have current,\n",
    "appropriate beneficiary designaons. You must designate at least one primary beneficiary within\n",
    "30 days of your coverage becoming effecve. Beneficiaries can be individuals, organizaons such\n",
    "as charies, or legal enes such as trusts.\n",
    "You can name mulple primary beneficiaries and specify the percentage each should receive, and\n",
    "these percentages must total 100%. It’s also wise to name conngent beneficiaries who would\n",
    "receive the proceeds if your primary beneficiaries predecease you. Without conngent\n",
    "beneficiaries, the insurance proceeds could end up being paid to your estate, which might create\n",

    "beneficiary. Changes become effecve immediately upon submission through the portal.\n",

This brings your total annual retirement savings to $6,600, combining your contributions and the employer match.\\n\\n**Why this matters to you**: This employer match is essentially \"free money\" that significantly accelerates your retirement savings, making it crucial to contribute at least enough to receive the full match.'}]...\n",
