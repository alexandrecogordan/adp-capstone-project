What if my course costs exceed the annual maximum? You’re responsible for any costs above the annual maximum limits. Consider planning your educational timeline to stay within annual limits or spreading courses across multiple years. Can I take courses that aren’t directly related to my current job? Courses should relate to your current role or reasonable career progression within TechLance. Liberal arts or unrelated courses require special approval with strong business justiﬁcation. What happens to my service commitment if I get promoted? Service commitments continue regardless of role changes within TechLance. Promotions or transfers don’t reset or eliminate your educational service obligations. Can I appeal if my educational program is denied?

Frequently Asked Questions Can I get reimbursed for online degree programs? Yes, online programs are fully eligible for reimbursement as long as the institution is regionally accredited and the program is approved through our standard application process. What happens if I get a grade below the minimum requirement? Unfortunately, grades below our minimum standards (C for undergraduate, B for graduate) don’t qualify for reimbursement.

Eligibility Requirements and Performance Standards To be eligible for tuition reimbursement, employees must have completed at least 12 months of continuous full-time employment or 18 months of part-time employment (minimum 20 hours per week). This tenure requirement ensures that employees have established themselves in their roles and demonstrated commitment to TechLance before receiving educational beneﬁts. Performance standards are equally important in determining eligibility. Employees must maintain a performance rating of “Meets Expectations” or higher on their most recent annual review, have no active disciplinary actions or performance improvement plans, and maintain good attendance with no unexcused absences in the past six months. These requirements ensure that educational pursuits complement rather than detract from current job performance. Throughout your course of study, you must remain actively employed and maintain full-time status if you’re pursuing degree programs. Part-time study is strongly encouraged to ensure that coursework doesn’t interfere with work responsibilities and performance.

Application and Approval Process The application process must be completed at least 30 days before your course begins to allow adequate time for review and approval. Rush processing is available with a 10-day minimum timeframe but requires manager approval and may not always be accommodated depending on the timing and complexity of the request. Your application package must include a completed TechLance tuition reimbursement application form, oﬃcial course descriptions or syllabus, detailed cost breakdown of all expenses, proof of institutional accreditation, and your most recent oﬃcial transcript.

What happens if I get sick while on vacation? If you’re hospitalized or have a serious illness during vacation that prevents you from enjoying your time oﬀ, those days may be converted to sick leave with proper medical documentation.

Our vacation policy is designed to provide fair and generous time oﬀ while ensuring business continuity and team collaboration. We believe that employees who take regular vacation time are more creative, engaged, and eﬀective in their work. This policy applies to all regular full-time and part-time employees and outlines how vacation time is earned, scheduled, and used. We encourage all employees to plan and take their vacation time throughout the year rather than allowing it to accumulate, as this approach best serves both individual well-being and team productivity. Vacation Accrual and Allocation TechLance provides vacation time based on length of service, recognizing that employees with longer tenure have demonstrated their commitment to the company and may have additional personal obligations that require more time away from work. During your ﬁrst year of employment, you will receive 15 vacation days, which equals 120 hours for full-time employees.

Upon returning from vacation, employees should plan for a reasonable transition period to catch up on developments and reconnect with ongoing projects. For extended vacations, managers may schedule re-entry meetings to help employees get back up to speed eﬃciently. TechLance views vacation time as an important employee beneﬁt that contributes to job satisfaction, retention, and overall performance. We encourage managers to model good behavior by taking their own vacation time and supporting their team members in using their beneﬁts. Employees should never feel guilty about taking earned vacation time or be made to feel that taking time oﬀ will negatively impact their career advancement. Administrative Details Employees can check their current vacation balance at any time through the HR portal, and this information is also included on each pay stub.

Vacation time is allocated annually on your hire date anniversary rather than on the calendar year, which ensures that every employee has a full year of service before receiving their complete vacation allotment. For new employees, vacation days are prorated based on your start date. For example, if you begin employment on July 1st, you would receive half of your annual vacation allocation for that ﬁrst year, with the remainder becoming available on your ﬁrst anniversary. While your annual vacation allocation becomes available on your hire date anniversary, vacation time accrues monthly throughout the year at a rate of one-twelfth of your annual allocation. However, newly hired employees must complete 90 days of employment before they can use any vacation time, except in cases of pre-planned vacations that were discussed and approved during the hiring process, or genuine emergencies that require manager approval.

You can discuss concerns with HR or request a trial period to demonstrate that remote work can be eﬀective in your role. How do I handle time zone diﬀerences if I move? You must maintain availability during our core collaboration hours regardless of your location, which may require adjusting your personal schedule to accommodate team needs. Can I work from coﬀee shops or coworking spaces?

What’s the diﬀerence between a copay and coinsurance? A copay is a ﬁxed dollar amount you pay for a service (like $25 for a doctor visit), while coinsurance is a percentage of the total cost (like paying 20% of a $1,000 procedure, which would be $200). Do I need a referral to see a specialist with the PPO plan? No, the PPO plan allows you to see specialists directly without a referral from your primary care doctor, though you’ll save money by staying in-network. Are prescription drugs covered? Yes, all plans include prescription coverage with diﬀerent copays based on whether the medication is generic, brand-name, or specialty. Mail-order options are available for 90-day supplies at reduced costs. What happens if I use an out-of-network provider? With PPO and HDHP plans, you’ll have coverage but pay higher costs and may need to submit claims yourself. The HMO plan only covers out-of-network care for emergencies. Can I add my domestic partner to my health insurance? Yes, domestic partners are eligible     \n",

      "     TechLance Health Insurance Policy Introduction TechLance is committed to supporting the health and well-being of our employees and their families through comprehensive health insurance coverage. We believe that access to quality healthcare is fundamental to employee satisfaction and productivity, which is why we contribute signiﬁcantly to premium costs and oﬀer multiple plan options to meet diverse needs and budgets. Our health insurance program includes three distinct plan types designed to accommodate diﬀerent healthcare preferences and ﬁnancial situations. Whether you prefer the ﬂexibility of a PPO, the coordinated care of an HMO, or the cost savings and tax advantages of a high- deductible health plan paired with a Health Savings Account, we have options that can work for you and your family. All eligible employees can enroll in health insurance coverage, with TechLance contributing 75% of the premium cost for employee-only coverage and 65% for family coverage. Coverage begins on the ﬁrst day of the month following 30 days of employment for new hires, and we hold an annual open enrollment period each November for changes that become eﬀective January 1st. Available Health Plans Our PPO plan oﬀers the greatest ﬂexibility in choosing healthcare providers and doesn’t require referrals to see     \n",

All EAP services are completely conﬁdential, and TechLance doesn’t receive any information about who uses these services or what assistance is provided. Enrollment and Life Changes New employees must enroll in health insurance within 30 days of their hire date. If you don’t enroll during this initial period, you’ll have to wait until the next annual open enrollment unless you experience a qualifying life event such as marriage, birth or adoption of a child, divorce, or loss of other health coverage. During open enrollment each November, you can change your health plan selection, add or remove dependents, or adjust your coverage for the following year. This is also the time to review your coverage and consider whether your current plan still meets your needs, especially if your family situation or health status has changed. Qualifying life events allow you to make changes to your health insurance outside of the open enrollment period, but you must notify HR within 30 days of the event and provide appropriate documentation. Changes due to qualifying life events are eﬀective immediately and don’t require waiting until the next plan year. Coverage Continuation and Appeals If you go on unpaid leave,     \n",

      "     you can continue your health insurance coverage through COBRA by paying the full premium plus a 2% administrative fee. COBRA coverage can last up to 18 months in most cases, though some circumstances may allow for longer continuation periods. If the insurance company denies a claim you believe should be covered, you have the right to appeal the decision. The appeals process typically involves submitting additional documentation or medical records to support your case. HR can help you understand the appeals process and connect you with insurance company advocates who can assist with complex situations. Most appeals are resolved within 30 days, and if your initial appeal is denied, you have the right to request an independent external review. It’s important to ﬁle appeals promptly, as there are time limits for challenging claim denials. This health insurance policy reﬂects our commitment to providing comprehensive, aﬀordable healthcare coverage for our employees and their families. We regularly review our oﬀerings to ensure they remain competitive and meet the evolving needs of our workforce, and we encourage employees to take an active role in understanding and managing their healthcare beneﬁts.

These virtual consultations are available 24/7 for non-emergency medical issues and can often provide convenient care without the need to visit a doctor’s oﬃce. The telemedicine platform can also prescribe medications when appropriate and is particularly useful for minor illnesses, follow-up care, and urgent medical questions. Mental Health and Employee Assistance Mental health coverage is integrated into all our health plans with the same copays and coverage levels as other medical care. This includes therapy sessions, psychiatrist visits, inpatient mental health treatment, and substance abuse programs. We believe that mental health is just as important as physical health and ensure that employees have access to the care they need. In addition to insurance coverage, all TechLance employees have access to our Employee Assistance Program (EAP), which provides conﬁdential support services at no cost. The EAP includes six free counseling sessions per issue per year, 30 minutes of free legal consultation, ﬁnancial counseling, and work-life balance resources. These services are available 24/7 and can be accessed by calling the number provided in your beneﬁts materials or through the EAP website. The EAP also provides childcare and eldercare referrals, which can be particularly valuable for employees     \n",

Once approved by your manager, HR will conﬁrm that you have suﬃcient vacation balance available, and you’ll receive email conﬁrmation of your approved time oﬀ. Vacation time can be taken in increments as small as four hours (half day), and there’s no minimum amount you must take at one time. However, we do have a maximum limit of 10 consecutive business days for vacation requests without special approval.

For extended vacations, managers may schedule re-entry meetings to help employees get back up to speed eﬃciently. TechLance views vacation time as an important employee beneﬁt that contributes to job satisfaction, retention, and overall performance. We encourage managers to model good behavior by taking their own vacation time and supporting their team members in using their beneﬁts.

Frequently Asked Questions How is my vacation time calculated if I work part-time? Part-time employees receive vacation time prorated based on their regular scheduled hours. For example, if you work 20 hours per week (half-time), you would receive half the vacation days of a full-time employee. Can I take vacation time during my ﬁrst 90 days of employment? Generally no, unless you have a pre-approved vacation that was discussed during hiring or there’s a genuine emergency situation that your manager approves. What happens if I get sick while on vacation? If you’re hospitalized or have a serious illness during vacation that prevents you from enjoying your time oﬀ, those days may be converted to sick leave with proper medical documentation. Can my manager deny my vacation request? Yes, if it conﬂicts with business needs, blackout periods, or if you haven’t provided adequate notice.

Employees with six or more years of service receive 25 vacation days annually, totaling 200 hours. Vacation time is allocated annually on your hire date anniversary rather than on the calendar year, which ensures that every employee has a full year of service before receiving their complete vacation allotment. For new employees, vacation days are prorated based on your start date. For example, if you begin employment on July 1st, you would receive half of your annual vacation allocation for that ﬁrst year, with the remainder becoming available on your ﬁrst anniversary. While your annual vacation allocation becomes available on your hire date anniversary, vacation time accrues monthly throughout the year at a rate of one-twelfth of your annual allocation. However, newly hired employees must complete 90 days of employment before they can use any vacation time, except in cases of pre-planned vacations that were discussed and approved during the hiring process, or genuine emergencies that require manager approval.
