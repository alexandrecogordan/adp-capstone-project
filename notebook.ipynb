HR can help you determine whether a speciﬁc program or institution would qualify for reimbursement before you begin the application process. This tuition reimbursement policy reﬂects TechLance’s commitment to employee development and lifelong learning. We believe that education beneﬁts both individual career growth and organizational capability, creating a win-win situation that strengthens our team and our business. We encourage employees to take advantage of these beneﬁts while maintaining their commitment to excellence in their current roles. Frequently Asked Question s Can I get reimbursed for online degree programs? Yes, online programs are fully eligible for reimbursement as long as the institution is regionally accredited and the program is approved through our standard application process. What happens if I get a grade below the minimum requirement? Unfortunately, grades below our minimum standards (C for undergraduate, B for graduate) don’t qualify for reimbursement. However, this doesn’t automatically disqualify you from future educational assistance. Can I pursue multiple certiﬁcations in the same year? Yes, but you’re limited to the annual maximum reimbursement amount for your category of education. Consider     \n",

Eligibility Requirements and Performance Standards To be eligible for tuition reimbursement, employees must have completed at least 12 months of continuous full-time employment or 18 months of part-time employment (minimum 20 hours per week). This tenure requirement ensures that employees have established themselves in their roles and demonstrated commitment to TechLance before receiving educational beneﬁts. Performance standards are equally important in determining eligibility. Employees must maintain a performance rating of “Meets Expectations” or higher on their most recent annual review, have no active disciplinary actions or performance improvement plans, and maintain good attendance with no unexcused absences in the past six months. These requirements ensure that educational pursuits complement rather than detract from current job performance. Throughout your course of study, you must remain actively employed and maintain full-time status if you’re pursuing degree programs. Part-time study is strongly encouraged to ensure that coursework doesn’t interfere with work responsibilities and performance. While we support employee development, your primary obligation remains to your current role and responsibilities at TechLance. The approval process begins with discussions between you and your direct manager about how the proposed education relates to your     \n",

Yes, employees typically pay all educational expenses upfront and submit for reimbursement after successful course completion with appropriate documentation. What if my course costs exceed the annual maximum? You’re responsible for any costs above the annual maximum limits. Consider planning your educational timeline to stay within annual limits or spreading courses across multiple years. Can I take courses that aren’t directly related to my current job? Courses should relate to your current role or reasonable career progression within TechLance. Liberal arts or unrelated courses require special approval with strong business justiﬁcation. What happens to my service commitment if I get promoted? Service commitments continue regardless of role changes within TechLance. Promotions or transfers don’t reset or eliminate your educational service obligations. Can I appeal if my educational program is denied? Yes, you can appeal to senior management with additional documentation about how the program beneﬁts both your career development and TechLance’s business objectives.

If your application is denied, you’ll receive written explanation of the reasons and information about the appeals process. Denied applications can be appealed to senior management with additional justiﬁcation about how the education beneﬁts both your career development and TechLance’s business objectives. Academic Performance Requirements To receive reimbursement, you must successfully complete your courses with grades of “C” or better for undergraduate courses and “B” or better for graduate-level courses. Pass/fail courses require a “Pass” grade, and professional certiﬁcations require successful completion and achievement of the certiﬁcation or license. You must submit oﬃcial transcripts within 60 days of course completion along with receipts and proof of payment for all covered expenses. No reimbursement is provided for failed courses, incomplete grades, or withdrawn courses, and repeated course failures may impact your eligibility for future educational assistance. The reimbursement request must be submitted within 90 days of course completion with all required documentation.

Application and Approval Process The application process must be completed at least 30 days before your course begins to allow adequate time for review and approval. Rush processing is available with a 10-day minimum timeframe but requires manager approval and may not always be accommodated depending on the timing and complexity of the request. Your application package must include a completed TechLance tuition reimbursement application form, oﬃcial course descriptions or syllabus, detailed cost breakdown of all expenses, proof of institutional accreditation, and your most recent oﬃcial transcript. You’ll also need to demonstrate how the education relates to your current role or reasonable career progression within TechLance. The review process involves multiple levels of approval.

Frequently Asked Question s How is my vacation time calculated if I work part-time? Part-time employees receive vacation time prorated based on their regular scheduled hours. For example, if you work 20 hours per week (half-time), you would receive half the vacation days of a full-time employee. Can I take vacation time during my ﬁrst 90 days of employment? Generally no, unless you have a pre-approved vacation that was discussed during hiring or there’s a genuine emergency situation that your manager approves. What happens if I get sick while on vacation? If you’re hospitalized or have a serious illness during vacation that prevents you from enjoying your time oﬀ, those days may be converted to sick leave with proper medical documentation. Can my manager deny my vacation request? Yes, if it conﬂicts with business needs, blackout periods, or if you haven’t provided adequate notice. However, managers should work with you to ﬁnd alternative dates whenever possible. Do I continue to accrue vacation time while on unpaid leave?

      "     TechLance Vacation Days Policy Introduction At TechLance, we recognize that taking time away from work is essential for maintaining personal well-being, preventing burnout, and ensuring our team members can return to their roles refreshed and productive. Our vacation policy is designed to provide fair and generous time oﬀ while ensuring business continuity and team collaboration. We believe that employees who take regular vacation time are more creative, engaged, and eﬀective in their work. This policy applies to all regular full-time and part-time employees and outlines how vacation time is earned, scheduled, and used. We encourage all employees to plan and take their vacation time throughout the year rather than allowing it to accumulate, as this approach best serves both individual well-being and team productivity. Vacation Accrual and Allocation TechLance provides vacation time based on length of service, recognizing that employees with longer tenure have demonstrated their commitment to the company and may have additional personal obligations that require more time away from work. During your ﬁrst year of employment, you will receive 15 vacation days, which equals 120 hours for full-time employees. This allocation increases to 20 vacation days (160 hours) beginning in your second year and continuing through your     \n",

This policy serves both the employee’s need for rest and the organization’s need to develop resilience and cross-training among team members. Upon returning from vacation, employees should plan for a reasonable transition period to catch up on developments and reconnect with ongoing projects. For extended vacations, managers may schedule re-entry meetings to help employees get back up to speed eﬃciently. TechLance views vacation time as an important employee beneﬁt that contributes to job satisfaction, retention, and overall performance. We encourage managers to model good behavior by taking their own vacation time and supporting their team members in using their beneﬁts. Employees should never feel guilty about taking earned vacation time or be made to feel that taking time oﬀ will negatively impact their career advancement. Administrative Details Employees can check their current vacation balance at any time through the HR portal, and this information is also included on each pay stub. If you have questions about your vacation balance or need clariﬁcation about how time oﬀ is calculated, please contact HR directly.

Vacation time is allocated annually on your hire date anniversary rather than on the calendar year, which ensures that every employee has a full year of service before receiving their complete vacation allotment. For new employees, vacation days are prorated based on your start date. For example, if you begin employment on July 1st, you would receive half of your annual vacation allocation for that ﬁrst year, with the remainder becoming available on your ﬁrst anniversary. While your annual vacation allocation becomes available on your hire date anniversary, vacation time accrues monthly throughout the year at a rate of one-twelfth of your annual allocation. However, newly hired employees must complete 90 days of employment before they can use any vacation time, except in cases of pre-planned vacations that were discussed and approved during the hiring process, or genuine emergencies that require manager approval. Scheduling and Approval Process We ask that employees provide advance notice when requesting vacation time to ensure adequate coverage and minimize disruption to team projects and client commitments.

Requests for three to four days oﬀ should be submitted at least two weeks in advance, while longer vacations of ﬁve or more consecutive days require three weeks of notice. During peak business periods or busy seasons, we ask for four weeks of advance notice to help with scheduling and workload management. All vacation requests must be submitted through our HR portal or directly to your manager for approval. Your manager will review the request considering team coverage needs, project deadlines, and other employees’ scheduled time oﬀ before approving. Once approved by your manager, HR will conﬁrm that you have suﬃcient vacation balance available, and you’ll receive email conﬁrmation of your approved time oﬀ. Vacation time can be taken in increments as small as four hours (half day), and there’s no minimum amount you must take at one time. However, we do have a maximum limit of 10 consecutive business days for vacation requests without special approval. Longer vacations require director-level approval and additional planning to ensure proper coverage and project continuity.

Flexible hybrid arrangements allow the split to vary by week based on business needs and project requirements. Teams often establish core days when everyone is expected to be in the oﬃce for collaboration and meetings.
